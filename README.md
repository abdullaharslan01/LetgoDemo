# Letgo App Demo

#### I developed this project by referencing the screen of the Letgo application, which is widely used in Turkey, to create a simple copy of estimated size using UIKit and Swift. Users can view uploaded ads, search, upload new ads, and access ad details using the application. Additionally, I designed my own PHP API to ensure security and stored user session information through this API. Other features of the application could also be added, and my goal was to create a demo by combining only the information I knew.
