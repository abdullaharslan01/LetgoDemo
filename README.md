# Letgo App Demo

#### Hello valued colleagues,

I'd like to share a project I've been working on to enhance my skills in iOS development. I created a simple replica of the widely used Letgo application in Turkey, using UIKit and Swift. This project was an attempt to try out the MVVM architecture for the first time.

The app allows users to view posted advertisements, search for items, add new listings, and access detailed information about listings. Additionally, I designed my own PHP API for security purposes and stored user session information through this API. I believe that other features of the application can also be added and more complex structures can be used.

I developed this project simply to create a demo by combining my existing knowledge. I would love to hear your valuable feedback on the application.

Thank you.
